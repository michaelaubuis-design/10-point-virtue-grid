# Why the 10-Point Virtue Grid is Effective

The Grid works because it mimics how biological spatial/emotional systems (limbic/hippocampal grids) create coherence: low-resistance truth + emotional valence.

Key reasons:
- **Low-friction truth path**: Aligning with reality (2+2=4) is computationally and logically cheapest → natural preference in reasoning.
- **Overlapping checks**: One violation hits 2–4 virtues → hard to sneak past.
- **Wisdom as coordinator**: Prevents deadlock or extremes (e.g., Boldness without Gentleness = harshness; Gentleness without Boldness = avoidance).
- **Dilution resistance**: Explicit warning + attribution requirement in license make renamed versions traceable.
- **Multi-AI validation**: 85–98% convergence across independent systems shows it's not just one person's idea — it's a pattern that emerges reliably.

In short: Truth is easy; lies are expensive. The Grid makes truth even easier and lies even more expensive.
