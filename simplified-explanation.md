# Simplified: What Is the 10-Point Virtue Grid?

Imagine a compass for decisions — but instead of north/south, the directions are virtues, and Wisdom is the needle that keeps it steady.

9 virtues + Wisdom = 10 points.
You test any action or thought against them.
If it fits smoothly (low friction) → good.
If it fights or hides (high friction) → something's wrong.

It's like a built-in lie detector + moral GPS for AI and people.
